  <h2 class='c023'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_8 c027'><span class='sc'>The</span> chief purpose of the study of
medicine is to acquire the knowledge
of a safe and effectual method of
curing diseases. The attainment of this
end is intimately connected with the public
good. Every endeavour to promote
it, therefore, may be considered as having
some claim to a candid examination.
In this persuasion, I submit the following
observations to public inspection.</p>

<p class='c015'>Few diseases are at present more common
than <i>lues venerea</i>. For its cure,
mercury is a medicine which is almost
universally employed; and the efficacy
with which it operates has long been confirmed
by unquestionable experience. But
the successful employment of mercury in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>this disease requires very particular attention;
and it is to be regreted, that, while
many suffer from the distemper, not a
few fall victims to what is used as the
remedy: All therefore that has hitherto
been said on this subject by no means
supersedes farther attempts to improvement.
To advance the practice of medicine
in this particular, is the intention
of the present publication.</p>

<p class='c015'>Nothing contributes more to safe and
effectual practice, than an acquaintance
with those principles on which remedies
operate. Hence, inquiries concerning
the operation of medicines have been,
and ever will be, prosecuted by those
who mean to practise on a solid or rational
foundation. Many practitioners,
indeed, hold every thing that is in the
least theoretical, in great contempt. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>alledge, that a physician possesses all the
knowledge requisite in medicine, who is
acquainted with particular remedies which
will infallibly cure particular diseases.
Could such remedies be discovered, their
reasoning would indeed hold good; and
medicine, which, of all arts, is in reality
the most difficult, would be the easiest.
But it is incumbent on those who reason
in this manner, to shew, that any such
remedies actually do exist. This, however,
is a point by no means determined;
and, with regard to it, very great doubts
may justly be entertained.</p>

<p class='c015'>With certain limitations, some few
such remedies may perhaps be allowed
to exist. But no one will pretend, that
these can, in every case, be employed
with equal success; or that, in all circumstances,
they are to be used in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>same manner. By a knowledge of the
principles upon which a medicine operates
in curing a disease, we can alone be
enabled to accommodate its use to particular
circumstances. He therefore who
knows, not only that a certain remedy
will cure a particular disease, but is likewise
acquainted with the manner in which
it acts in producing that effect, has at least
a double advantage.</p>

<p class='c015'>Errors in theory, indeed, often mislead
in practice; and opinions, supported
by numerous arguments, after being
long believed, have at length been discovered
to be without foundation. But
this imperfect state of theory, in place
of being any objection to its utility, is
an additional inducement to continue,
with unremitting ardour, a pursuit in
which so much still remains to be done.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>It is by unwearied assiduity alone that improvement
can be expected in any art.
The imperfection of theory, then, can
be no argument for discontinuing farther
attempts to render it more perfect.</p>

<p class='c015'>Theory in medicine is principally despised
by two sets of practitioners, the
ignorant and the lazy; the last are unwilling,
and the first are unable, to acquire
the knowledge of it; and, amidst
all their boasted contempt, it will be found,
that they principally differ from others in
implicitly adopting whatever opinions they
first receive. Theory is natural to the
human mind; and those who are accustomed
to think cannot be satisfied without
assigning a reason for every phænomenon
which falls under their observation.
Theory by no means precludes
observations: On the contrary, it leads to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>a more minute attention to facts; and in
this way opinions, of themselves ill founded,
have often given rise to useful discoveries
in practice. For these reasons, in
treating of mercury in the venereal disease,
I have esteemed it necessary to begin
with some observations on its operations.</p>

<p class='c015'>There are few medicines, with regard
to the operation of which all practitioners
are agreed. Mercury, as well as others,
has, in this respect, been a subject
of dispute. It is indeed the misfortune
of medicine, that many points of great
consequence still remain in a very doubtful
state. But it affords at least some
chance of arriving at truth, that, in the
present age, it is never esteemed criminal
to differ even from the highest authorities:
On the contrary, those whose authority
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>should deservedly have the greatest
weight, are unwilling that any farther
deference should be paid to their opinion
than arises from conviction. He therefore
who imagines, that an ill-grounded opinion
is generally received, has nothing to
restrain him from a candid inquiry. But
arguments adduced in favour of any opinion
will have little weight, if another be
previously received as true. To ensure
therefore a fair examination, it is, in the
first place, requisite to remove prepossession.
These remarks will sufficiently account
for the attention I have here bestowed
in attempting to refute an opinion
different from that which I endeavour to
establish.</p>

<p class='c015'>It is an opinion taught, and at this
place very generally received, with regard
to the operation of mercury, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>the good effects it produces, in the cure
of <i>lues venerea</i>, are to be ascribed to the
evacuation which it occasions. After attentively
examining this hypothesis, I cannot
help thinking that it is ill founded.
Notwithstanding, therefore, the authority
by which it is supported, I have, with
freedom, stated what to me seem strong
objections against it.</p>

<p class='c015'>After having endeavoured to overturn
one hypothesis, I have attempted to
establish another. The opinion I support
is by no means new. The honour
of invention therefore must be totally resigned
to others; but the praise of broaching
novelties is always to be relinquished
when it comes in competition with the
support of truth; and I should consider
myself as having done a great deal, were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>I able to give satisfactory evidence of any
important but doubtful point.</p>

<p class='c015'>After this inquiry concerning the
operation of mercury in the venereal disease,
I next proceed to make some observations
with regard to its use.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mercury has been employed in the
cure of the venereal disease in a great
variety of forms. Most of these, upon
their first introduction into practice, have
been extolled as the safest and most effectual
method of using it in every case.
Experience, however, sufficiently demonstrates,
that this holds with regard to no
mercurial preparation hitherto discovered.
Whether such a preparation may
yet be discovered, is difficult to say. In
this treatise, I have not proposed any
mercurial which was not formerly in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>use. But if, on the one hand, I have
no title to lay claim to the merit of a discovery,
I cannot, on the other, be charged
with being the first proposer of any
dangerous practice.</p>

<p class='c015'>In treating of the use of mercurials
in <i>lues venerea</i>, my aim has been different
from that of most authors. What I
have principally had in view, is not so
much to recommend any particular preparation,
as to determine the comparative
advantages of some of the most
effectual ones at present in common
use. I have likewise endeavoured to
point out those circumstances to which
each is best adapted. To this I have
subjoined the principal cautions to be observed
in the employment of mercurials;
those more especially which respect the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>nature of the medicine, the condition of
the patient, and the necessary regimen.</p>

<p class='c015'>On these subjects, a good collection
of observations would unquestionably be
of the highest utility. How far I have
succeeded, must be left to others to determine.
To those who imagine I have
not altogether failed, I need offer no excuse
for having published. To those who
are of a contrary opinion, it will be sufficient
to observe, that every attempt to
be serviceable should apologise for itself.</p>

    <div><i>Of the General Properties of Mercury.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_8 c027'><span class='sc'>Mercury</span> is a production of the mineral
kingdom. In its natural
state, it is of an opaque metallic substance,
of very considerable specific gravity. To
the eye, it appears like melted lead, or
silver; from which it has derived the
name of <i>quicksilver</i>. In this condition,
when freed from every admixture, it has
neither any perceptible smell nor taste;
and, as its application to the most sensible
parts of the body occasions no irritation,
we may conclude, that it is void of all
acrimony.</p>

<p class='c015'>By very intense cold, artificially excited,
mercury may be brought to a solid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>form; but, in the greatest natural
cold hitherto known, it remains always
in a fluid state. By heat it is rendered
very volatile, exhaling totally in fumes;
these fumes, upon being exposed to cold,
condense again into running mercury.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mercury, like most other metallic
substances, is found in the earth, either
in a pure state, or in that of an ore. The
first has been called <i>virgin-mercury</i>, and
is in general found by the miners in drops
or small grains; sometimes indeed it is observed
in larger quantities, and forms the
appearance of small streams. In the state
of ore, it is most frequently combined
either with sulphur, or with earthy matters;
from which it is readily extracted
by distillation. It is found in both these
states in different places of Europe, particularly
in Spain and in Hungary; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Britain is principally supplied with it from
the East-Indies.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mercury was not unknown to the
antients. In the early ages of medicine,
indeed, it seems to have been esteemed
a virulent poison; but it has now, for
some centuries past, been much, and
successfully, employed for the purposes
of medicine, as well as of other arts.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Arabians were the first who employed
it in the cure of diseases; but they
seem to have used it externally only, and
applied it for discussing tumors, cleansing
ulcers, and curing cutaneous eruptions.
Soon after the introduction of the venereal
disease into Europe, mercury was found
to be the most expeditious and
most effectual, if not the only certain, remedy.
The advantages which are to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>derived from its employment in this disease,
both when applied externally, and
taken internally, have now been confirmed
for a length of time too considerable
for allowing the least foundation either
to doubt its efficacy, when properly used,
or to dread its deleterious effects, when
judiciously managed.</p>

<p class='c015'>The effects of mercury on the human
system in a sound state are very various.
When mercury, in its crude state, is introduced
by the mouth into the alimentary
canal, it passes off by stool, without
producing any effect. It has indeed been
alledged, that in this state, in some morbid
affections, it may be useful in removing
obstructions by its weight. But it
is to be remembered, that, in a great
part of its passage through the intestines,
it rises in opposition to gravity, and that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>it is very apt to divide in such a manner
as to make its way through very small openings.
This effect, then, is perhaps
in general, if not always, to be disregarded.</p>

<p class='c015'>When mercury is prepared in such a
manner as to be readily soluble in the fluids
of the human body, the effects it produces
are much diversified. Its action is often
immediately exerted upon the stomach;
in which case vomiting is produced. This
effect is observed from the use of many
mercurial preparations. The brown and
green precipitates and calcined mercury
act as rough and strong emetics; but the
preparation principally used, where it is
intended to act as an emetic, is the yellow
precipitate, or Turpeth mineral.</p>

<p class='c015'>Many of those mercurials, which have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>not such an influence upon the stomach
as to produce vomiting, upon entering the
intestinal tube, act as purgatives. This
effect of mercurials is, among other preparations,
particularly remarkable on the
use of the Coralline mercury, Prince’s
powder, or calomel.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mercurials, which fail in producing
either purgative or emetic effects, frequently
act as diaphoretics. Diaphoresis,
or even a profuse sweat, is often the consequence
of many of the mercurials already
mentioned. But when this effect
is wanted, by means of mercurials, it is
most commonly obtained by the use of a
solution of corrosive sublimate.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mercury entering the circulating system
exerts particular effects on different
excretories; but in a more especial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>manner on those of the saliva. Salivation
is an effect which may be obtained from
the proper administration of almost every
mercurial preparation; but for this purpose
either the mercurial pills, or friction
with mercurial ointment, are most
frequently employed.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mercury may enter the system, exist in
considerable quantity there, and be carried
off by the different excretories, without
producing any remarkable evacuation,
or other apparent change, on the sound
state of the body. That it is actually
present in the system in such cases, is demonstrated
by a general tendency to an
increase in all the secretions. Mercury
in this way, although it produces no visible
effect on a healthy person, often procures
the removal of a diseased state.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>Its action, therefore, in such circumstances,
is termed <i>alterative</i>; an effect
which may be obtained from most of the
mild mercurials, especially when used in
small doses.</p>

<p class='c015'>From these various modes of operating,
it may readily be concluded, that
mercury must be a powerful remedy in
the cure of many diseases. The undoubted
effects which it produces on the human
system, when labouring under the
venereal distemper, it would be both difficult
and unnecessary fully to enumerate.
It heals ulcers, removes swellings, alleviates
pains, and cures eruptions. In
short, the almost infinite variety of symptoms
under which this disease makes its
appearance may, by a proper application
of mercury, be effectually eradicated from
the constitution.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>From these effects, it is not surprising,
that, in this distemper, mercury is the
almost universal remedy. But, while it
cannot be denied that peculiar advantages
may be reaped from the employment
of mercury in the venereal disease,
it must at the same time be acknowledged,
that, from the injudicious use of this
medicine, very great evils have been produced.
Whatever, therefore, relates to
its proper administration, must be esteemed
of importance. But to determine
this, it is in the first place requisite to
ascertain the principles upon which it operates.
In treating of the present subject,
then, an examination of the most
probable opinions, with regard to the
mode of its operation in the venereal disease,
first claim our attention.</p>

  <h2 class='c023'>CHAP. II.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c028'><i>Concerning the Opinion, that Mercury
cures the <span class="blackletter">Lues Venerea</span> by
the evacuation it produces.</i></p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_8 c027'><span class='sc'>There</span> are few medicines with regard
to the operation of which all practitioners
are agreed. It is, however, by no
means incumbent on him who means to establish
the truth of any one opinion to overturn
every hypothesis advanced on the
same subject. But, as the arguments urged
in favour of any hypothesis will have much
less weight when another is previously
believed to be true, and as the regulation
of practice is, in every case, to a certain
extent, founded upon theory, no
inconsiderable advantage may be derived
from overturning an ill-founded opinion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>especially when it is generally received.
The theory of the action of mercury, as
well as of other substances, has afforded
room for a diversity of opinions. For
the reasons mentioned above, then, although
it is by no means intended, that
every opinion, with regard to the operation
of that medicine, should here be
considered; yet, as it is a very prevailing
opinion, that the good effects obtained
from mercury in the cure of <i>lues venerea</i>,
depend upon its action as an evacuant;
and, as a variety of seemingly strong arguments
have been adduced in favour of
that hypothesis, it will be necessary to
examine how far they are sufficient to establish
its truth.</p>

<p class='c015'>In favour of the opinion, that mercury
cures <i>lues venerea</i> by acting as an evacuant,
the following arguments have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>employed. It is alledged, that the good
effects obtained from mercury in the cure
of this disease, are in proportion to the evacuation
which it produces; that the cure
produced by mercury depends more upon
the stimulant power of the preparation
which is employed, than upon the quantity
taken; and that the same good effects are
obtained from other evacuants as from
mercury; particularly, that the venereal
disease is cured in a similar manner from
the employment of guaiac. The arguments
here enumerated, if not the only
ones upon which this opinion is founded,
are at least those which are principally
employed. To examine, then, how
far these are well founded, will be sufficient.</p>

<p class='c015'>The first argument here adduced is,
that the good effects of mercury are proportioned
to the evacuation which it produces.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>This assertion, if allowed to be
true, might, at first sight, appear to be
a very strong argument in favour of the
theory here adopted. But it is strong in
appearance only; for, although it should
be admitted, it in fact proves nothing.</p>

<p class='c015'>But, even previous to this, it might
be made a question, how far what is here
assumed as a fact is well founded? And
if it should appear, that mercury does
not cure <i>lues venerea</i> in proportion to
the evacuation which it produces, a strong
argument might from thence be brought
against this theory. But what may be
said on this question will, with greater
propriety, occur when the objections to
the theory come to be adduced, than in
attempting to refute and invalidate the
arguments brought in its favour. At
present, it will be sufficient to show, that,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>even allowing it to be true, it is no argument
in favour of the supposition.</p>

<p class='c015'>If it be true, that mercury cures <i>lues
venerea</i> in proportion to the evacuation it
produces, it may indeed, with some degree
of probability, be concluded, that
the evacuation and cure are not unconnected.
And, if the evacuation is not
the cause of the cure, it might at least
from thence be inferred, that both of
them depend upon the same cause; but
it no more, unquestionably, follows from
thence, that the evacuation is the cause
of the cure, than that the cure produces
the evacuation.</p>

<p class='c015'>The degree of evacuation which, in
any case, arises from the employment of
mercury, will, it is natural to imagine,
be proportioned to the quantity of active
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>mercury which is introduced into the system.
But, in whatever way mercury acts
in the cure of the venereal disease, it may
then be supposed to act most powerfully
when it is present in the system in most
considerable quantity. In this point of
view, then, the evacuation which arises
from the use of mercury is to be considered
merely as an index of the quantity
of the medicine which is introduced
into the system in an active state; and
the cure may be proportioned to the evacuation,
only as pointing out the degree
in which the mercury exists in the
habit. Even supposing, then, that the
foundation upon which this argument is
built were not to be called in question,
yet, taken in its greatest latitude, it is
still at best but doubtful; and from it no
conclusion can be drawn in favour of the
theory which it is brought to support.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>The second argument mentioned in
proof of the supposition that mercury
acts, in the cure of <i>lues venerea</i>, as an
evacuant, was, that the cure produced
by mercury depends more upon the stimulant
power of the preparation employed,
than upon the quantity of mercury
which is used.</p>

<p class='c015'>This argument may be answered in
the same manner with the preceeding. It
is indeed true, that different preparations
of mercury, when used in equal quantities,
have by no means equal influence
in the cure of <i>lues venerea</i>. There is
seldom an opportunity of observing what
would be the effects of the most stimulant
preparations, as, in the venereal disease,
they are by no means in common
use; and as, from their action on the
alimentary canal, they exert very violent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>effects, without entering the circulating
system. They, in general, operate very
roughly, both as emetics and purgatives;
but it is not clear that, in the venereal
disease, any benefit has been obtained
from their effects in either of these ways.
It can therefore by no means be allowed,
that the foundation of this argument, in
its full extent, is strictly true. It cannot
indeed be denied, that some preparations
of mercury, which possess a considerable
stimulant power, have a greater influence
in the cure of <i>lues venerea</i>, than several
others which are less stimulant. So far,
then, the foundation upon which this argument
is built, must be allowed to be
just, and its weight, as tending to establish
this theory, requires a refutation.</p>

<p class='c015'>But, even admitting it to be just,
without any reserve, still, no more than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>from the former, can any conclusion
be drawn from this in favour of the
theory which it is meant to support. It
has already been observed, that, in whatever
way mercury operates in the cure
of <i>lues venerea</i>, its good effects may always
be supposed to be proportioned to
the quantity of the medicine which enters
the system in such a state as to become
active there. But the quantity of
active mercury entering the system can
in no case be judged of from the quantity
of the preparation which is employed.
One preparation of mercury much
more readily admits of a mixture with
the animal fluids than another; in consequence
of this, it will find a more ready
entrance into the system. And further,
this variety in the facility of access into
the system, not only holds in different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>preparations, but even in the same preparation
at different times.</p>

<p class='c015'>In proof of the first of these propositions,
we have a convincing example in
the difference which is observable between
the effects arising from the use of
crude mercury, and of this metallic substance,
when no other means are used to
render it active than simple trituration.
It is well known, that even a very inconsiderable
quantity, taken in this last way,
will soon shew its effects at the most remote
excretories of the body; in the other,
although swallowed to the quantity
of many pounds, it is a very rare occurrence
that any effects can be observed
from which it can be concluded, that it
has, in any degree, entered the mass of
circulating fluids.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>But it was likewise alledged, that mercury,
used at different times, although
given in equal quantities and in the same
form, produces very different effects.
Crude mercury, as has already been observed,
although swallowed in considerable
quantities, rarely produces any other
effect on the body, than what arises from
the passage through the alimentary canal.
This, however, although generally, is
not universally the case. On some occasions,
when taken in this way, it operates
with as great activity as when used
in any other form; and, from many well
attested instances, it appears, that, by being
swallowed even in a crude state, a
high salivation has been excited. In
this we have an instance in which a
remarkable difference of effect arises
from the employment of the same preparation
at different times. This difference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>cannot arise from the quantity of
mercury employed; for while, in some
cases, no operation of the nature here
mentioned takes place from the use of a
large quantity, in others, it will be excited
where an inconsiderable quantity only has
been taken. The difference of effects here
observed, then, must be ascribed to some
other cause; and it is most reasonable to
refer it to particular accidents in the constitution
at the time the medicine is used.
In these cases, where no operation takes
place from its use, it may be concluded,
that the whole quantity of mercury swallowed
has passed through the alimentary
canal in the same state in which it was
taken in. When, on the other hand,
an operation upon the salivary glands, or
any other excretory remote from the alimentary
canal, is observed from the use
of crude mercury, it may be concluded,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>that part of the mercury, from some peculiarity
in the habit at the time, such, for
example, as the presence of superabundant
acid in the stomach, has been
brought into such a state as to be capable
of entering the circulating system. From
these instances, then, it evidently appears,
that the facility with which mercury enters
the system, admits of very great variety.
And from this a strong objection
may be adduced against the argument
here brought to support the hypothesis
that mercury cures <i>lues venerea</i> by its evacuant
power.</p>

<p class='c015'>It is alledged, that mercury cures <i>lues
venerea</i> by the evacuation it occasions;
because the good effects derived from its
employment are observed to be more in
proportion to the stimulant power of the
preparation which is used, than to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>quantity of mercury taken. The data,
however, here assumed by no means lead
to the conclusion deduced from thence.
The most stimulant preparations of mercury,
by their action on the <i>primæ viæ</i>,
are in general immediately expelled from
the system. When this happens, they
have no influence in the cure of venereal
complaints. When they are not
thus expelled, their nature is such that
they most readily enter the system. Their
superior action, then, may be accounted
for without supposing that it depends on
their producing the most considerable evacuation.</p>

<p class='c015'>From the facts as here stated, it indeed
follows, that the good effects obtained
from mercury are greatest in those cases
in which the mercury enters the system
in most considerable quantity. The evacuation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>it is true, is then likewise greatest.
But this will unquestionably follow as
the necessary consequence of the presence
of active mercury in the system, and can
by no means be concluded to be the
cause of the cure. The evacuation which
occurs in this case, then, as was observed
in the objections adduced against the
last argument, can be considered only as
an index of the quantity of active mercury
which is present in the system. The
superior activity, therefore, which some
stimulant preparations possess, when compared
with those of a milder nature, is
by no means a proof of the supposition
that mercury cures <i>lues venerea</i> by means
of the evacuation which it produces; and
this argument, as well as the former, may
be set aside.</p>

<p class='c015'>The third argument mentioned in favour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>of this theory, and the last which we
proposed to consider, is, that the same
good effects, in the cure of <i>lues venerea</i>,
may be obtained from the employment
of other evacuants, as from that of mercury;
and particularly, that the venereal
disease is cured in a similar manner by
the use of guaiac.</p>

<p class='c015'>This argument, if well founded,
would indeed be a conclusive proof of
the theory, in support of which it is here
adduced. Evacuation may be occasioned
by a great variety of other means
besides mercury. The influence of any
discharge, as tending to cure <i>lues venerea</i>,
will fall more particularly to be considered
in stating the objections against
this theory. A full answer, then, to the
first part of this argument, would at present
be superfluous: But it may be observed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>that it is by no means a common practice
to attempt the cure of <i>lues venerea</i>
by the safest and most effectual evacuants
now in use; and that, when evacuants
are employed for the cure of other
diseases, while a venereal infection at
the same time exists in the system, it is
never found to yield to them. This first
part of the argument, then, may be shortly
answered, by denying it to be true.</p>

<p class='c015'>It is indeed true, that much benefit
has been alledged to be obtained from
guaiac in the cure of the <i>lues venerea</i>.
Experience, however, has sufficiently
demonstrated, that these testimonies are
not altogether to be relied upon. The
influence of guaiac may perhaps be very
considerable in certain stages of <i>lues venerea</i>,
when the malignity of the disease
is already overcome by means of mercury;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>or in particular climates, where the
nature of this infection seems to be in
some degree different from what it is in
this country. But, how far the good
effects of guaiac are established by facts
in this climate, and before a cure
has been attempted by mercury, is
still a matter of great doubt. And, at
any rate, even the most sanguine advocates
for the use of guaiac will allow, that
the good effects obtained from its use
are by no means to be put in competition
with those which are derived from
the employment of mercury.</p>

<p class='c015'>But, even admitting all that has been
said in favour of guaiac to be strictly
true, still it does not follow, that it
cures the <i>lues venerea</i> by evacuation.
Many medicines which operate much
more powerfully as evacuants have no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>such effect. And, what was formerly
said with regard to the cure of <i>lues venerea</i>,
being proportioned to the evacuation
produced by mercury, may perhaps,
with equal justice, be applied to guaiac.
It cannot be, with certainty, concluded,
that the evacuation in either case is to be
looked upon as the cause of the cure,
since, in both, it may only be its concomitant.
From this argument, then,
nothing can be inferred, which has any
tendency to establish the truth of the
theory in support of which it is adduced.</p>

<p class='c015'>Thus have we examined the different
arguments used in favour of the supposition,
that mercury cures <i>lues venerea</i>
by acting as an evacuant. And,
from this examination, it appears, that
they admit of satisfactory answers. What
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>has then been said in proof of the theory,
can by no means be considered as sufficient
to establish its truth. But the insufficiency
of the arguments adduced in
support of it, is not the only reason
for not adopting it. There are many
objections to this hypothesis, which
would have been sufficient for rejecting
it, even supposing that the arguments
brought to prove it had been such, that
no falacy in them could have been detected.
That this theory, then, may,
with less hesitation, be set aside, it will be
necessary to mention a few of these objections.</p>

<p class='c015'>It obviously occurs as a first objection
to this theory, that evacuation, from its
nature, cannot easily be supposed capable
of producing a cure of <i>lues venerea</i>.
The changes which evacuation may produce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>upon the fluids of the body, can
only be conceived to be of two kinds.
They must either depend on a diminution
of the quantity of the fluids, or on
a change of their quality. But, it is
not easy to conceive how the effects of
the <i>venereal virus</i> should be removed, or
on what footing this virus should be expelled
from the system, by either of these
changes, when induced by evacuation.</p>

<p class='c015'>A mere diminution of the quantity of
circulating fluids, is certainly insufficient
for the cure of <i>lues venerea</i>. The venereal
matter, as present in the body,
must either be diffused through the
whole mass of fluids, or confined to
particular parts only. If it be diffused
through the whole mass, the taint, even
after the most considerable evacuations,
will remain equally strong in the fluids
still left in the body. And, as the venereal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>virus evidently possesses a power of
assimulation, when in the human system,
the whole mass of fluids would soon
return to its former state. This being
the case, then, it must be allowed, that
an inconsiderable diminution of quantity
cannot reasonably be supposed to counteract
an infection which exists in the
remaining mass.</p>

<p class='c015'>If, on the other hand, the venereal
poison be supposed to exist only as a noxious
matter in the body, when collected
at particular parts, it is equally difficult
to conceive, how evacuation from its nature
should produce a cure. It never
has been observed, that mercury particularly
encreases the discharge by those
parts where the venereal matter appears
actually to exist. In almost every case
where it is used only internally, there is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>no encrease of evacuation by venereal ulcerations.
It cannot, however, be imagined,
that a discharge which takes
place by the salivary glands or skin, will
particularly evacuate what is lodged in
the genitals, or extremities. We may
therefore, with certainty, conclude that
evacuation does not at least cure <i>lues
venerea</i> by any change arising merely
from a diminution of the quantity of
circulating fluids.</p>

<p class='c015'>Evacuants may perhaps be alledged
to operate in the cure of <i>lues venerea</i> in
another manner. It may be supposed,
that they remove the distemper from
a change which they produce in the
quality of the circulating mass. But,
from the smallest consideration, it will
appear, that this supposition is equally
unsatisfactory as the former. If, from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>evacuation, a diminution takes place equally
from every part of the mass of
circulating fluids, no change of quality
will ensue. If, however, this proportion
is not properly observed, a change
of quality will indeed take place. But
that change will consist merely in the
diminution of particular parts in a compound
mass, and can never be supposed
to remove a contagious matter of any
kind, even supposing it to be lodged in
the particular part of that mass thus diminished.
Much less will it remove
an infectious matter uniformly diffused
through the whole parts of the compound
mass, or existing as a morbid
matter in particular parts of the body
only. From the nature of evacuation,
then, whether it be supposed to operate
by a diminution of the quantity of
circulating fluids, or by any change it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>can produce in point of quality, it may
readily be concluded, that it is by no
means fitted for the cure of <i>lues venerea</i>.</p>

<p class='c015'>Another and more conclusive objection
against the supposition that mercury
cures <i>lues venerea</i> by evacuation, is, that
this disease is by no means cured by
evacuation taking place in an equal, or
even in a greater degree, from other
causes. This, however, should of necessity
be the case, were the former supposition
well founded. Effectually to overturn
this theory, then, it will be necessary
only to establish the truth of this
assertion.</p>

<p class='c015'>It cannot perhaps be alledged, that
any fair trial has ever been made of evacuation,
instituted solely with a view to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>cure the venereal disease, and that in such
cases it has been found to fail. But,
without any such trial, there are sufficient
arguments to shew, that for this purpose
it really is ineffectual.</p>

<p class='c015'><i>Lues venerea</i> would never, upon its
first introduction, have been considered
as so unconquerable a disease, could it
have been cured by evacuation. Various
modes of evacuation were then in common
use in medicine, and considered
as the most effectual means of cure in
many diseases. The venereal distemper,
till the introduction of mercury, resisted
the power of almost all the medicines
employed against it; and, in some parts,
it was at that time reckoned so incurable,
that the police of the country obliged
the unhappy sufferers who laboured under
it to separate themselves from all intercourse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>with the rest of mankind. While
this was the condition of the distemper,
is it to be imagined that every method
of cure was not tried? May we not,
then, conclude, that, upon the first introduction
of this disease, evacuation,
by every known means, and carried to
the greatest height, was had recourse to,
but without effect?</p>

<p class='c015'>But, to prove that evacuation will not
cure the distemper, it is needless to travel
back to the first periods of this disease,
or to rest the evidence even upon
the highest probability. From what occurs
in many morbid cases, we have every
day evident proof of the insufficiency
of any discharge for producing a cure of
the venereal disease. <i>Lues venerea</i> often
exists at the same time with diseases in
which an increase of natural evacuations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>takes place. None of these diseases, whether
the evacuation happens by the salivary
glands, as in small-pox, by stool, as in
dysentery, or by the skin, as in intermittents,
have ever been found to break its
force, much less to produce a perfect
cure.</p>

<p class='c015'>Besides what happens in natural evacuations,
we have likewise proofs of the
insufficiency of artificial evacuations for
the cure of this disease. Although evacuation,
at least by other means than by
the use of mercury, is never now employed
as a cure for the venereal disease;
yet venereal complaints are often complicated
with others, for which various evacuations
are proper. And while evacuations
are, with success, employed for
the cure of these, it is found, that the
venereal taint either remains unchanged,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>or is even increased in force. It cannot
here be alledged, that the difference of
effect depends upon the mode of evacuation.
On such occasions, every mode
of evacuation has been tried with equal
want of success. Even salivation, which
was long considered as the only effectual
discharge, when excited by other
means than by mercury, or even by mercury
itself, when externally applied to
the organs secreting saliva, has not been
found more effectual than other modes
of evacuation. In some cases, indeed,
mercury received into the mouth by
steam, or otherwise, has had good effects;
but these were either to be accounted
for from its application to the
diseased part, or from its introduction
into the system. It is, then, sufficiently
evident, that evacuation, at least by other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>means than mercury, does not cure
<i>lues venerea</i>.</p>

<p class='c015'>To this theory it may be urged as a
third, and not less powerful objection
than any of the former, that where the
evacuation arising from the use of mercury
in <i>lues venerea</i> is the greatest, the
cure is often retarded; and that mercury
never more frequently fails than in those
cases where it begins to evacuate upon
its first introduction into the system.</p>

<p class='c015'>That these assertions are true, at least
of the obvious discharge produced by mercury,
will not be refused by any advocate
for its action as an evacuant. To this,
indeed, they may think it a satisfactory
answer, that the influence of mercury
as an evacuant cannot be judged of from
the apparent discharge. It may be alledged,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>and indeed with some appearance
of reason, that the greatest discharge
produced by mercury is by insensible
perspiration; that mercury, in consequence
of this, is a more powerful evacuant
than many other medicines by which
a greater obvious evacuation is produced;
and that it has the effect to increase
perspiration in a more remarkable degree,
when it increases no other discharge
than when it induces the greatest obvious
evacuation. But although it cannot be
denied, that the use of mercury does increase
insensible perspiration; and that
evacuation in this way may, on some
occasions, be greater than what would
arise from salivation or any other obvious
discharge; yet these facts by no means
tend to any conclusion which will remove
the difficulty formerly stated. Nor can
it from thence be supposed, that mercury
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>always evacuates most powerfully in those
cases where it produces the most successful
cure.</p>

<p class='c015'>The degree of evacuation which takes
place from the employment of any medicine
cannot indeed, in every case, be
ascertained by the obvious discharge.
But, where the judgment formed from
this test would be fallacious, the marks
of inanition consequent upon the use of
any medicine are always certain tests for
determining the degree of evacuation.
From these it is evident, that the suppositions
here advanced, that mercury
operates more powerfully as an evacuant
than any other medicine, and that it always
produces a greater discharge when
it acts by the skin, than when it affects
the salivary glands, or any other excretory,
are entirely without foundation.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>From the marks of inanition appearing
in the system, it is demonstratively
proved, that, from a variety of other
means, a greater evacuation can be produced
than from mercury. In such circumstances,
however, by mercury the
venereal disease is cured, by these other
evacuants it is not. And farther, where
the cure of <i>lues venerea</i> has been retarded
by a salivation occurring early, or
where no cure has taken place after salivation
has been continued for a considerable
time, there is every mark of a
much higher degree of inanition than
when the disease has been removed by
mercury without any sensible evacuation.
There can remain no doubt, then, that
the cure of <i>lues venerea</i> is by no means
in proportion to the evacuation which it
produces. This, however, should necessarily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>be the case, were the cure effected
by evacuation.</p>

<p class='c015'>Upon the whole, then, from what has
been said of this theory of the action of
mercury in the cure of the <i>lues venerea</i>,
it appears, that the cure can by no means
be referred to the evacuation. The different
arguments adduced in favour of
that theory, we have endeavoured to
shew, either proceed on wrong principles,
or, although admitted in their
greatest latitude, can afford no ground
for any conclusion to support it. Evacuation,
from its nature, whether supposed
to operate by diminishing the quantity
of circulating fluids, or by any
change it can induce in their quality, can
scarce be conceived to be a cause adequate
to the cure of <i>lues venerea</i>. Evacuation
does not produce a cure of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>venereal disease, when it takes place in
an equal, or even in a much greater degree,
from the employment of other medicines,
than when the disease is effectually
removed from the use of mercury.
And, <i>lastly</i>, the venereal disease is never
more effectually cured by mercury, than
when it is evident, from every mark by
which the degree of evacuation can be
determined, that the evacuation arising
from it is least considerable. It may,
therefore, with confidence be asserted,
that mercury does not cure <i>lues venerea</i>
by evacuation.</p>

</div>
<p class='c028'><i>Concerning the Opinion, that Mercury
cures <span class="blackletter">Lues Venerea</span>, by acting as an
Antidote to the Venereal Matter.</i></p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_8 c027'><span class='sc'>It</span> is an undoubted fact, that mercury,
by proper management, cures <i>lues
venerea</i>. From the arguments already
adduced, it has been concluded, that the
cure, thus obtained, is not the consequence
of evacuation. Having rejected
this prevalent opinion, then, it next remains
to say, in what manner a cure is
produced.</p>

<p class='c015'>It has long been an opinion, very generally
received, that mercury is a substance
capable of destroying the venereal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>virus; or that, from being united with
this virus, possesses a power of rendering
it inactive. Many arguments tend to
prove, that this is in reality the case;
and that in this manner it cures <i>lues venerea</i>.
But, at the same time, this theory
is not to be considered as without difficulties.
The first that occurs, is, with
regard to the mode in which an opportunity
is afforded for a mixture of the
mercury with the virus.</p>

<p class='c015'>It is, in general, imagined, that mercury
may destroy the venereal virus in the
mass of circulating fluids. The venereal
virus is unquestionably taken into
the human system by the absorbent
vessels to which it is applied; and, before
it can reach various parts of the body,
in which it evidently manifests itself,
it must enter the general mass of fluids.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>We cannot, then, consider it as a supposition
totally absurd, that mercury, if it be
capable of destroying the activity of the
venereal matter, may produce that effect
while the virus is present in the general
mass of fluids. Many objections, however,
may be urged against this supposition;
and, if it be adopted, it must be allowed
to be with difficulties.</p>

<p class='c015'>If mercury destroy the venereal virus,
while it exists in the mass of circulating
fluids, it must produce this effect,
either by an alteration of the general
mass; or by acting more particularly on
the venereal matter itself. The whole
mass of circulating fluids, taken collectively,
is a very considerable quantity of
matter. The action, therefore, of a small
proportion of mercury, as producing any
change upon it, cannot be very great.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>It is not easy to conceive, then, how a
destruction of the venereal virus should
arise from any alteration which the mercury
is capable of producing on the
general mass.</p>

<p class='c015'>The difficulty occurring to the first supposition
here made, would naturally lead
us to consider the second. But that the
action of mercury, while it exists in the
mass of circulating fluids, should be exerted
on the venereal virus alone, is a
supposition equally unsatisfactory as the
former. Before this can be imagined to
be the case, it is necessary to suppose, that
there exists, between mercury and the
venereal virus, some particular attraction.
Such an attraction, however, is a thing
as yet by no ways proved to exist; nor
indeed does there seem to be any shadow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>of reason to suppose that it does exist.</p>

<p class='c015'>Although, then, it cannot be denied,
that mercury and the venereal virus may
exist in the mass of circulating fluids at
the same time; yet, from what has been
said, the supposition, that the activity of
the virus is then destroyed, will appear
to be attended with many difficulties. It
cannot, it is true, be alledged, that, from
any thing which has been urged, this
supposition is refuted. That it may perhaps,
in some degree, act in this way, is
by no means impossible. But it is to be
remembered that this is a hypothesis supported
by no proof; and the more imaginary
any opinion is, the less easily can
it be overturned. The present opinion,
then, may be set aside, for reasons, which,
in other respects, would be insufficient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>for its being rejected; and this the more
readily, if another and more probable
hypothesis can be advanced which is not
liable to the same objections.</p>

<p class='c015'>To determine the manner in which
mercury acts on the venereal virus, it
might seem requisite that the nature of
this poison should first be ascertained. In
what the activity of the venereal virus
consists, it is difficult, perhaps impossible,
to say. Various conjectures have indeed
been offered with regard to it. But what
has hitherto been advanced upon that subject
is so hypothetical as scarce to deserve
a serious refutation. What could, therefore,
be derived from an inquiry of this nature,
without a more perfect knowledge
of the subject than has hitherto been attained,
would be but of little utility.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>But, although the peculiar nature of
the venereal virus, and those principles
in consequence of which it becomes active,
are unknown, yet its general effects,
as acting on different parts of the
human body, are sufficiently obvious.
The parts morbidly affected by the venereal
virus, at different times, put on
different appearances. This, however,
is in common to all of them, that, when
reduced to the state of an open ulcer,
they discharge an infectious matter capable
of propagating the disease. It cannot
therefore be doubted, that the venereal
matter occasions the morbid affections
there observed from its actual
existence at these places.</p>

<p class='c015'>As the places evidently affected by the
venereal poison are frequently very distant
from those to which the poison has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>been first applied, and do not lie in the
course of the absorbents, it can only be
carried to them in the course of circulation.
But, even while the poison is
present in the circulating system, no
change can be detected on the general
mass of fluids; nor in by much the
greater part of the solids in the body.
Many changes may take place in the
fluids of the human body which cannot
be said to constitute a diseased state.
That such changes may be esteemed
morbid, it is necessary that they should
manifest themselves over the system in
general. If, then, we are to judge
by these principles, it follows, that the
venereal poison does not produce a
morbid state in the general mass of
fluids. It evidently acts as a cause of
disease in particular parts, whether it
first comes to be applied to these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>by immediate contact with external objects,
or arrives at them in the course of
circulation. Probably it acts as a morbid
cause in these places, from being, by
some accident, detained there, in consequence
of which the quantity of the poison
is increased by assimilation. This
opinion, with regard to the influence of
the venereal virus in producing the disease,
will lead to a different conjecture
concerning the operation of mercury, as
tending to destroy it.</p>

<p class='c015'>If this opinion be true, the venereal
poison may be supposed to be productive
of disease, only when collected
at particular parts. This would lead
us to conclude, that, if mercury possess
a power of destroying the venereal
virus when it comes in contact with it,
it can only produce a cure of <i>lues venerea</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>from being topically applied to the
poison collected at particular parts of
the body.  Mercury, however, unquestionably
does produce a cure of
the venereal disease. If, then, it can
be shewn, that mercury in reality is an
antidote to the venereal virus; and that,
previous to its producing a cure, it is
topically applied to those parts in which
the venereal virus is lodged, we may reasonably
conclude, that the cure obtained
from its use is to be referred to its action
as an antidote from topical application.
To establish this supposition, then,
it is first necessary to show, that the
mercury is in reality topically applied to
the venereal matter.</p>

<p class='c015'>Many medicines, taken into the alimentary
canal, are known to have
the most powerful effects in the cure of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>diseases very remote from thence. While
this happens, there are the strongest reasons
for believing, that the medicine itself
never passes the alimentary canal, or
is in any respect introduced into the system.
In such cases, therefore, it evidently
produces a good effect on parts
to which it is never applied. It may
then occur, as a possible supposition at
least, that this likewise may be the case
with mercury.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mercury indeed produces many good
effects by its action on the <i>primæ viæ</i>.
But, when it is given in any of those
forms in which it is of service in the venereal
disease, those cases excepted where
it is immediately applied to the diseased
part itself, various phænomena tend to
prove, that it actually does enter the
mass of circulating fluids. It is only,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>from the introduction of mercury into
the system, that various actions which it
exerts in different parts of the body can
be accounted for. Thus, for example,
when it excites salivation, whether from
being taken by the mouth, or from being
rubbed upon the extremities most remote
from the salivary glands, there is
every proof which can be required that
the mercury is actually present at these
glands. The taste alone is sufficient to
evince this. From the same mark also,
we may be assured of the presence of
mercury in the mouth, even when it is
not introduced into the system in such a
quantity as to excite salivation.</p>

<p class='c015'>In all these cases, the mercury can only
reach the mouth in the course of circulation.
But, if it enter the mass of
circulating fluids, it must, from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>known and established laws of circulation,
be equally carried to every different
part of the body; and, among others,
it cannot fail to be applied to those parts
in which the venereal matter does exist.
This first assertion, then, may be considered
as sufficiently established; and, it
remains only to show, that mercury,
when it comes in contact with the venereal
matter, has a power of destroying
it.</p>

<p class='c015'>That mercury, when it is exhibited in
such a manner as to be capable of conjunction
with the venereal matter, has a power
of rendering it inactive, is an assertion,
which, it might be imagined, could be
put to the test of experiment. But, experiments
of this nature could not be
performed without hazard; and, in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>end, would perhaps be only undecisive.
Although, however, no certain criterion
has in this manner been obtained, there
are not wanting arguments to render the
opinion at least highly probable.</p>

<p class='c015'>In favour of the supposition, that mercury,
in reality, possesses a power of rendering
the venereal virus inactive, it may
be observed, that an action in this manner
is at least conceivable; and that it is
analogous to what we have an opportunity
of observing in other cases of nature.
Many substances which possess the
most active powers in nature, have these
entirely destroyed, or totally altered, from
combination with other substances. This
holds remarkably of mercury itself,
when united with sulphur. These, taken
separately, are each of them substances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>of a most active nature; conjoined, the
mixture becomes inert, or acts only as
sulphur.</p>

<p class='c015'>From what has been said, then, it appears,
that, in some cases, mercury by
combination loses its active powers.
But this fact will appear less singular,
if such a destruction of powers
holds not of mercury alone, but of other
substances likewise. That it does, is
exemplified in the mixture of sulphur
with different metallics, as in the case of
antimony. In the mixture of acids with
alcalines, there is, if not a destruction of
activity, at least a total change of properties.
But to multiply instances of
this kind, would be superfluous. Enough
has been said to show, that there is at
least nothing inconsistent with the common
course of nature, in supposing, that
such a mutual relation takes place betwixt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>mercury and the venereal virus.
It may then be considered at least as a
possible supposition, that, from the addition
of the former, the latter is destroyed,
or rendered inactive.</p>

<p class='c015'>But the proof of this antidotal power
to the venereal virus in mercury, need
not be rested upon a mere possibility.
That mercury, in reality, does possess a
power of destroying the activity of this
poison, is rendered, if not certain, at least
highly probable, from the circumstance
of its curing venereal ulcers in consequence
of topical application. In daily
practice, we have undeniable proof, that
mercury, topically applied, does cure venereal
ulcers. This holds not only of
those ulcers to which dressings can be
applied, and continued for a considerable
length of time, but of others also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>more out of reach, where its application
can only be temporary. The advantages
obtained from the different modes
of applying mercury to ulcers in the
throat, whether in the form of steam or
gargle, sufficiently shew the truth of this
assertion.</p>

<p class='c015'>The cure produced in all the cases of
ulcers to which mercury is topically applied,
is unquestionably to be referred
to an immediate action upon the part.
It takes place without any marks of the
mercury having entered the system.
And it can by no means be alledged,
that, in such cases, any general affection,
such, for example, as an increased
discharge, is produced. But it
is perhaps needless to insist on this, as
in those instances the cure is never attributed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>to any other mode of operation
than that of immediate action.
As far, then, as the assertion, that mercury
cures ulcers from topical application,
can prove any thing in favour of its possessing
an antidotal power, it may be assumed
as an undeniable fact.</p>

<p class='c015'>It has indeed been alledged, that the
cure here arising from the topical application
of mercury, is entirely to be referred
to its action as a stimulus to those
parts to which it is applied. But this is
an opinion, which, for many reasons,
can by no means be admitted. Other stimuli
which operate more immediately and
more strongly, have by no means an equal
effect. When mercury stimulates in the
highest degree, the best consequences
are by no means observed to arise from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>it. And it often produces a cure from
topical application, where no effects of
its operating as a stimulus can be observed.
From these facts, it is evident,
that the cure of venereal ulcers, produced
by the topical application of mercury,
can by no means be referred to
its stimulant power. This naturally
leads us to ascribe it to some other cause.</p>

<p class='c015'>In the venereal disease, different parts
of the body are ulcerated, and kept in
that state, from the activity of the venereal
poison. When, therefore, these ulcers
come to be healed, the natural conclusion
is, that the activity of the virus,
which occasioned and supported the ulceration,
is destroyed. But if mercury
applied to venereal ulcers does cure them,
when that cure cannot be ascribed to
any action of mercury, either upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>system in general as an evacuant, or upon
the part particularly affected, as a
stimulant, may we not, with justice,
say, that it possesses a power of destroying
the activity of this virus? in other
words, that mercury is an antidote to
the venereal poison? From this, then,
it follows, that the action of mercury
as an antidote, is not merely a thing
possible, and analogous to what happens
in other cases of nature; but that the real
existence of such a power is incontestably
proved.</p>

<p class='c015'>To this argument, it may indeed occur
as an objection, that mercury does
not in every case, from topical application,
produce a cure of venereal ulcers.
This, it might be imagined, should happen,
did it operate in the manner here
alledged. But it is to be remembered,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>that the venereal virus may often be so situated,
while it produces an external sore,
as to be totally out of the reach of any
application made to the surface of that
sore. And, even in cases where the seat
of the virus is superficial, the mercury
may be applied in such a form as will not
readily admit of a conjunction with the
virus. Those cases, therefore, in which
mercury has failed of producing a cure,
can never afford any sufficient reason for
setting aside this argument. But, on the
other hand, any one well vouched instance,
in which mercury, by being topically
applied, has produced a cure in the
manner here alledged, is a sufficient
foundation, for every thing which has
been advanced from this fact, to prove
the supposition of its being an antidote to
the venereal poison.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>From what has been said, it appears,
that mercury is an antidote to the venereal
virus; and that, whether it be introduced
into the circulating system, or
used externally only, it comes in contact
with the venereal virus in those parts in
which it is lodged, previous to its producing
a cure. It may, then, be reasonably
concluded, that the theory formerly
suggested is well founded; and that
mercury cures <i>lues venerea</i> from its power
as an antidote, in consequence of its being
actually applied to the venereal matter.</p>

<p class='c015'>In favour of this hypothesis, it may
farther be urged, that it is confirmed by
a proper attention to many phænomena
attending the cure of <i>lues venerea</i> by mercury;
while at the same time it is not equally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>liable to objection, as the other
theories which have been mentioned.</p>

<p class='c015'>From the supposition of a topical action
in the manner here supposed, the
fluid to be acted upon is, as it were, separate
and distinct from the general mass.
In this case, then, the objection, that the
effects of the mercury will be taken off
from the quantity of matter upon which
it has to act, will not apply. At the
same time there is here no necessity for
having recourse to any hypothetical attraction
between mercury and the venereal
virus.</p>

<p class='c015'>It cannot, indeed, be alledged, that,
in this case more than in the former, any
obvious change occurs in the appearance
of the venereal matter in consequence of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>the use of mercury. But the venereal
matter, even in the most detached state
in which it ever exists in the human body,
is always blended with a certain proportion
of pus and other humours. From
this circumstance, we can never become
acquainted with what is its real appearance.
It cannot, therefore, be reasonably
expected, that any changes which
take place in it should become the object of
observation. But observation sufficiently
demonstrates a manifest difference in the
effects produced by this virus, after the
use of mercury, when compared with
those which that virus before produced.
That, therefore, in consequence of the
employment of mercury, its nature is
in reality changed, is but a reasonable
conclusion.</p>

<p class='c015'>It was formerly adduced, as an argument
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>in favour of another supposition,
that the cure of <i>lues venerea</i> produced
by mercury was proportioned to the
quantity of discharge which the mercury
occasions. This assertion we have already
attempted to show is by no means,
in every case, true. It must, however,
be allowed, that in some cases it does
hold, and in those cases more especially
where the discharge takes place from the
system in general. To account for this
on the theory here advanced, it is only
necessary to consider in what manner
such a discharge arises from the internal
use of mercury.</p>

<p class='c015'>These evacuations are, without doubt,
to be referred to the mercury reaching
and acting upon the excretories by which
they are made. The quantity of these
discharges, then, will, in many cases,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>serve as a standard by which to determine
the quantity of active mercury circulating
in the system. But, in proportion
to the quantity of mercury which
circulates in the general mass of fluids, a
greater or less quantity will come to be
applied to every part in the body; and,
among others, to those places in which
the venereal matter exists. Upon the supposition,
then, that mercury acts in the
cure of <i>lues venerea</i> as an antidote, it is
easy to see how the cure should, in such
cases, come to be proportioned to the
quantity of the discharge.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mercury, as was already observed,
does not always produce a cure from external
application. Where this fails, the
cure is often effected by internal use.
Mercury, from being used internally,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>comes to be applied to parts otherwise
inaccessible, and even to the interior surface
of superficial sores, to which, from
external application, it cannot penetrate.
From this, it is obvious on what principles
the internal use of mercury co-operates
in the cure of <i>lues venerea</i> with external
application; or produces a cure
alone where it is not used externally at
the same time.</p>

<p class='c015'>Although the cure of <i>lues venerea</i>
from mercury may often correspond with
the quantity of the evacuation, yet it frequently
happens, that, from the early
increase of any one particular discharge,
the cure is frustrated. This is particularly
experienced in those patients in
whom the almost immediate effect of
mercury is to excite salivation. While this
fact is a very strong objection against the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>supposition that mercury cures by operating
as an evacuant, it can readily be accounted
for upon the theory here adopted.
In such habits, the quantity of mercury
accumulated in the circulating fluids
can never be very great, as it finds a
ready outlet from the system.</p>

<p class='c015'>Besides these phænomena, this theory
affords a ready solution for many others
also. From hence it is easy to account
for the obstinacy of this disease after
it has affected the bones. When
that has happened, the application of
mercury to the part affected, whether it
be externally applied, or taken internally,
can only be obtained after long continued
use.</p>

<p class='c015'>From this also we can learn the reason
why the venereal disease will sometimes
return, without any new infection, after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>a seemingly complete cure by means of
mercury. The disease will be apparently
cured, because the mercury may have totally
destroyed the poison at some particular
parts; but it will return from the virus
still remaining lodged in others, to
which, from a course sufficient to destroy
it in more accessible parts, the mercury
could never penetrate.</p>

<p class='c015'>It appears then, that to the other arguments
formerly adduced in favour of
this theory, may be added, the ready
solution it affords for various phænomena
observed with respect to the cure.
And, from all the arguments taken together,
it may be concluded, that this
theory is to be adopted, if not as absolutely
certain, at least, as less embarassed
with difficulties, and as supported by
more probable arguments than any other.</p>

  <h2 class='c023'>CHAP. IV.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c028'><i>Of the different Mercurial Preparations employed in Medicine.</i></p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_8 c027'><span class='sc'>Metallic</span> substances in general,
when employed for the purposes
of medicine, have been used in many
different forms: But none of them, perhaps,
has been exhibited in a greater diversity
of preparations than mercury.
Some mercurial preparations have never
been employed in the cure of <i>lues venerea</i>;
and many formerly in use are entirely
banished from the present practice
in this disease. All these may be considered
as unconnected with the subject
here treated of. But that the nature
of those preparations which are at present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>most frequently employed, may be
more clearly understood, there will be no
impropriety in taking a general view of
all the preparations of mercury.</p>

<p class='c015'>The mercurial preparations admitted
by the Colleges of London and Edinburgh,
contain the most useful and most
elegant forms employed in practice, at
the time when the last editions of their
Pharmacopœias were published. But
even at that time they were by no
means to be considered as compleat
lists. And, since that time, other preparations
of utility in practice have been
discovered.</p>

<p class='c015'>A more full view of mercurial preparations
than can be obtained from these
lists, and, at the same time, some information
with regard to the circumstances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>in which they differ from each other, may
be had from a table of mercurials lately
published by Dr Saunders of London.
In that table, which, with a very few inconsiderable
alterations, is the same with
one formerly given out by Dr Cullen,
when professor of chemistry at Edinburgh,
the different mercurial preparations
are reduced to general heads, according
to the means employed to render
them active. From it, the following
is almost entirely copied. The names
of the different preparations are here
printed in Italics, and taken from the London
and Edinburgh Dispensatories, from
the new Dispensatory, and from the
Edinburgh Pharmacopœia Pauperum.
To these are added, some mercurials introduced
by Boerhaave, Astruc, Keyser,
and Plenck. From the letters subjoined
to each, it will appear from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>whence the preparations are taken; and,
where an asterisk is prefixed to any one,
it denotes, that it is to be considered as
perfectly analogous to that immediately
preceeding.</p>

</div>
<p class='c028'><i>Of the Mercurial Preparations intended
to act immediately on the
Parts affected with <span class="blackletter">Lues Venerea</span>.</i></p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_8 c027'><span class='sc'>Every</span> preparation of mercury may
perhaps, under proper management,
be successfully employed in the
cure of the venereal disease. But by
much the greatest number of these preparations
neither are, nor ever have been,
in common use for that purpose. To
treat, at any considerable length, of all
that are at present in use, would lead to
prolixity and repetition. A few observations
on those which, from their being
most successful, are at present most frequently
employed, will afford sufficient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>data for determining the choice of one
preparation in preference to another.</p>

<p class='c015'>The different modes in which mercury
has been exhibited have very universally
been reduced to two general heads, and
referred either to its employment externally
or internally. This division, however,
is not without some degree of inaccuracy.
Mercury, when taken internally,
is very universally thrown into the
system in general, without any particular
attention to the affected part. When it
is used externally, it is for the most part
meant to act immediately on the diseased
part. This, however, is not always the
case; and sometimes the only thing intended
by external application is its introduction
into the system. But, when this
is the case, its external employment is on
precisely the same footing with its internal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>use. The proper distinction, then,
depends not so much upon its being used
either externally, or taken by the mouth,
as upon the mode in which it is meant
to act. Mercury, in every case, is intended
either to act immediately upon
the affected part, or to enter the circulating
system.</p>

<p class='c015'>If there be any truth in what has been
said with regard to the action of mercury,
the manner in which, in each of
these ways, it comes to produce a cure,
can readily be conceived, and is, at bottom,
very similar. But, at the same time,
these different modes of using the medicine
are, in some measure, fitted for different
purposes; and the influence which
is exerted in the one way demands attention,
which is not always requisite in
the other. These methods of using mercury,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>then, may, with greater advantage,
be considered separately than together.
And what would claim consideration,
in the first place, are those modes of application,
in which the mercury is intended
to act immediately upon the affected
part.</p>

<p class='c015'>From the opinion which was long entertained,
that mercury, in every form,
was a substance highly poisonous, it is
not surprising, that, upon its first introduction
into medicine, it should have
been used externally only. In this way
it seems also to have been first employed
in the venereal disease. But, from the
tendency which mercury has to enter the
system, when used in any form, it is not
surprising that its effects, as exciting salivation,
should soon have appeared from
its use externally. To a salivation thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>excited, it was but natural to attribute
the cure. Hence, from its external employment
on its first introduction, there
are few clear instances of its efficacy as
acting immediately upon the venereal
virus.</p>

<p class='c015'>It is not, however, improbable, that,
even in these early periods, some part of
the influence which mercury had in the
cure of <i>lues venerea</i> was to be ascribed to
an immediate action on the venereal matter.
In this way the good effects, in many
cases, reaped from fomentations of
cinnabar, one of the modes of applying
mercury first put in practice, were certainly,
in some measure, to be accounted
for. It may, then, be affirmed, that
the use of mercury, so as to act immediately
upon the affected part, is a mode
of applying it as early as its first introduction
in the venereal disease. And,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>from examining the history of this distemper,
as well as the various means
which have, at different times, been employed
in the cure, it will appear, that
the immediate action of mercury on parts
affected by <i>lues venerea</i>, particularly in
places most easily reached, such, for example,
as chancres, has always been a
common intention in practice.</p>

<p class='c015'>But enough has perhaps been said
concerning the history of the immediate
application of mercury. The present inquiry
is with regard to the preparations
now employed in this way, and the comparative
advantage of each.</p>

<p class='c015'>Among the first, and perhaps the most
common forms in which mercury has
been, and still is applied, with a view of
acting immediately upon the affected
part, are the mercurial ointments, cerates,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>and plasters. In this, as will appear
from the table which has been given,
the mercury is rendered active by
division. Little difference can arise from
the substance with which the mercury is
combined during the triture. All these
preparations, therefore, may, with propriety,
be considered together. To this
head may be referred, the blue ointments,
mercurial cerate, and common
plaster with mercury, of the London
College; and the mercurial ointment, and
plaster, of the Edinburgh.</p>

<p class='c015'>These preparations seem to contain a
very large proportion of mercury; and
certainly, in their composition, a considerable
quantity is blended. But it by
no means follows, that the whole of
that quantity is in an active state, or is
in such a condition as to be capable of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>an union with the venereal virus. From
late observations, it appears, that by
much the greatest part of the mercury,
although here rendered invisible, is still
in its crude state. The effect, therefore,
to be expected from them is by no means
to be judged of from the quantity of
mercury which has been employed in
making them. And they are in reality
much weaker preparations than might be
imagined.</p>

<p class='c015'>These are often employed as dressings
to open sores. But the oily nature of
the substances with which the mercury is
here conjoined, prevents it from admitting
of a ready union with the venereal
virus. On this account, their power will
be still farther diminished than from the
cause formerly mentioned. Hence it
may be concluded, that they are not the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>most proper mercurial applications for
open ulcers. And indeed an examination
of the state of the fact confirms this
conjecture. For, upon inquiry, it will
be found, that in such circumstances
greater benefit may be reaped from other
mercurial applications.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mercury is often meant to act in the
venereal disease, without any general
affection of the system, or without entering
the mass of circulating fluids,
where it cannot come into immediate
contact with the affected parts. These
parts are often deep seated, and, at the
same time, the integuments above them
are unbroken. In such cases, mercury,
applied in a form capable of penetrating,
or of being absorbed, promises to be of
service. That mercury, in the forms
here mentioned, is in this situation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>cannot be denied. And, in such cases,
these forms have the peculiar advantage,
which many others want, of admitting of
an easy, gradual, and long continued
application. Hence it is, that singular
benefit is obtained from them in the
resolution of nodes and buboes.</p>

<p class='c015'>It may not be improper here to observe,
that, for these intentions, particularly
the last, which is an affection of
the lymphatic glands, it is a very effectual
mode of using the mercury, to apply
it in the form of unction to those
places from which the lymphatic vessels
passing through the diseased gland take
their rise. In this way, equal if not
greater benefit will, in general, be reaped,
than from immediately applying it
to the tumor itself. By this means, the
mercury will be carried with more certainty,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>and in greater quantity, to the affected
gland, than it would be from pervading
the substance of the integuments.</p>

<p class='c015'>Another form in which mercury
was very antiently used, and still continues
to be applied with an intention of
acting immediately upon affected parts,
is, its being reduced into a state of vapour,
by which means it acquires a very
high degree of activity. This mode of
applying mercury is attended with many
inconveniencies, and, in this form, its
application, while it is very sudden, can
at best be but temporary. It must, however,
be allowed, that the active form
which the mercury here assumes is a very
subtile one. By this means, it becomes
capable of penetrating and resolving
hard and indurated tumors, which
cannot be pervaded by mercury in other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>forms. On this account, in such tumors,
especially if they have been of long
standing, and in obstinate ulcers which
have resisted other mercurial preparations,
the form of vapour may often be
tried with peculiar advantage. For this
purpose, cinnabar has commonly been
employed. From its being resolved
into fume, the mercury and sulphur
are disunited, and the activity of the
medicine totally depends upon the former
arising in a state of vapour.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mercury, in whatever way it is used,
is most active in these forms in
which, from the addition of acids, it is
reduced to a saline state. Some of these
are in their nature so extremely corrosive,
that they can scarcely, with safety, be
used even as external applications. This
peculiarly holds of those preparations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>which are formed by a combination of
mercury with the nitrous acid. That
they may be fitted for use, therefore, various
means are employed to render
them milder. Among other methods,
one frequently practised, is, the abstraction
of acids by calcination. In this
manner are prepared the <i>mercurius corrosivus
ruber</i> of the London college, and
the <i>praecipitatus ruber</i> or <i>calcinatus</i> of
the Edinburgh. These are forms of
employing mercury which are every day
in use, for application to the part immediately
affected.</p>

<p class='c015'>These preparations, even after having
their action in this manner diminished,
still possess a very considerable
degree of corrosive power. On this account,
they become particularly useful
in many cases of venereal complaints,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>where corrosives are required. And
hence it is easy to learn the foundation
for the frequent and advantageous
employment of these preparations in cases
of fungous edged ulcers, of warts, and
other such tumors.</p>

<p class='c015'>That these preparations may be applied
more commodiously, they are frequently
mixed with different ointments,
particularly with basilicon; but, by this
means, their power of action is greatly
diminished. Where it is intended they
should act as escharotics, it is perhaps in
every case most proper to employ them
in the form of dry powders. Such dressings
may then be applied above them as
are best fitted to the nature of the complaint.</p>

<p class='c015'>It may naturally be imagined, that,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>from mercury in this form, not only an
escharotic power can be obtained, but
that likewise, from its action as an antidote
against the venereal virus, parts
kept ulcerated, from the activity of this
poison, may be healed. That, in some
degree, it is fitted for this purpose likewise,
is not to be doubted. But, to its
employment in this way, its corrosive
power is often an objection. In many
cases, where it is required that an ulcer
should be healed, a destruction of solid
parts would be highly prejudicial. And
when, in order to avoid this, the corrosive
power of the mercury is diminished,
from its being united with an ointment,
the precipitate becomes liable to
the same objection which was formerly
urged against the efficacy of mercurial
ointment. It is then in a state which does
not admit of a ready union with the venereal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>virus. It may therefore, upon
the whole, be concluded, that mercury
in this form is principally useful in those
cases, where, with the effect of an antidote
against the venereal virus, it is necessary
to conjoin an escharotic power.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mercury may be rendered saline by
being united with other acids as well as
the nitrous. These likewise are, in general,
active preparations; but they do not
possess a caustic power, at least in so high
a degree as the nitrous preparations.
Among the most active of the other saline
preparations, are those prepared with
the muriatic acid, and especially the corrosive
sublimate. This is a mercurial
preparation which, in many cases, may
be employed to act immediately on parts
affected by the venereal virus; it falls,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>therefore, to be considered also under this
head.</p>

<p class='c015'>The stimulant power of corrosive sublimate
is so great that it is never, even
for external purposes, used in a solid
form. But the <i>aqua phagedænica</i> of
the Edinburgh College, which is a solution
of it in lime-water, is a mercurial
preparation which has often been used
externally, both in venereal and other
foul ulcers. This form, however, contains
so large a proportion of the mercury,
that it is by much too stimulant
for the greatest part of sores. A more
dilute solution, in common spring-water,
is free from this inconvenience, while,
at the same time, it serves every purpose
which can be expected from the other.</p>

<p class='c015'>The mercury in this solution is in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>a state sufficiently active to destroy the
venereal virus, and is, at the same time,
in a condition which will admit of a ready
union with it. Good effects, therefore,
might naturally be expected from it, especially
as the form is such that it can with
ease be applied.</p>

<p class='c015'>The efficacy of this preparation has
not indeed, as far as I know, been confirmed
by long or extensive practice.
But, where it is proper to heal superficial
ulcers, no application is of greater service
than dressings of lint dipt in a solution
of the corrosive sublimate in the proportion
of half a grain to an ounce of water.
The addition of a small quantity of compound
spirit of lavender to this solution
will give it a colour and smell different from
those of common water, which, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>some patients, are necessary conditions
to an effectual application. In some circumstances
already mentioned, the other
modes of applying mercury to act immediately
upon the diseased part may be
preferable to this. But, where the only
requisite to the healing of an ulcer is the
destruction of that venereal virus at the
part which supports a diseased state there,
no application will answer the purpose
with greater facility, safety, and expedition,
than this solution.</p>

<p class='c028'><i>Of the Mercurial Preparations intended
to act in the cure of <span class="blackletter">Lues
Venerea</span> by entering the System.</i></p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_8 c027'><span class='sc'>An</span> attempt has already been made
to explain the operation of mercury,
and the manner in which the venereal
poison may be supposed to exist as a cause
of disease. From these it might perhaps
be concluded, that the introduction of
mercury into the system was seldom requisite.
And it might seem reasonable to
infer, that all the advantage which could
be obtained from mercury, might be had
from its application in one or other of
the ways already mentioned. So far,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>however, is this from being the case,
that it is no uncommon thing with practitioners
to inveigh, in the most express
terms, against all external applications,
those excepted which are of the mildest
and most inactive nature. Mercurials
have not been excluded, and the healing
up of sores, by whatever external
means it may be effected, has been
considered as highly prejudicial.</p>

<p class='c015'>It can by no means be asserted, that
these accusations against the external use
of mercury are entirely without foundation.
If properly understood, however,
they may be true, without being any objection
to the theory. It can never be
imagined, that, from the destruction of
the venereal virus at a particular part,
by any application made there, it
should be destroyed in the rest of the system.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>When, therefore, the venereal
virus has already been absorbed, a radical
cure cannot be expected from the
healing of an ulcer. It may even sometimes
happen, that, from a partial destruction
of the virus in an ulcer, it may
be healed externally, and, at the same
time, absorption more considerably promoted
than if it had remained open.</p>

<p class='c015'>From these circumstances it is easy to
see, that, upon the theory formerly adopted,
the introduction of mercury into the
system is, in many cases, not only proper,
but even necessary. But, at the
same time, the advantages which, from
that theory, we are led to expect from
the immediate application of mercury to
parts affected by the venereal virus are
not less true.</p>

<p class='c015'>As the first method of using mercury
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>was by external application, for an action
on the parts affected; so external application
was likewise the first means employed
for introducing it into the system. For that
purpose, all the various modes of applying
mercury, which have already been mentioned,
have, at different times, been
used. Applications of mercury to the
surface of the body by unction, plaster,
fumigation, and lotion, have each, at
different times, and by different practitioners,
been recommended as the safest
and most effectual method of introducing
it into the system. But, after longer and
more accurate observation than could at
first be obtained, the application of mercury
in the form of unction is the only
method of introducing it into the system,
by external application, which is now in
practice.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>Whatever may be the means used
for introducing mercury into the system,
it is certain, that, if it do enter it in an
active state, it will cure the disease. Its
introduction by unction is still by no
means an uncommon practice. By several
modern practitioners, this method
of introducing it into the system is still
recommended, as preferable to every
other. When properly viewed, however,
it must be allowed, that if it be attended
with advantages on the one hand,
it is by no means free from inconvenience
on the other, and in certain circumstances
only is a preferable practice.</p>

<p class='c015'>In the mercurial ointment, the preparation
which is here used, the mercury,
as was formerly observed, is rendered
active from division by triture. The
mercurials prepared in this manner are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>in general the mildest in which mercury
is in an active state. It may be laid down
as an undoubted fact, without pretending
in this place to assign any cause
for it, that the milder mercurial preparations
have a greater tendency to operate
by salivation than the more acrid.
But there is perhaps no method of exhibiting
mercury in which it more certainly
operates by salivation, than when it is
applied externally in the way of unction.</p>

<p class='c015'>After what has been said by the
greatest authorities in medicine against
salivation, it would be unnecessary to add
any thing here. It may be sufficient to
observe, that it has been pronounced to
be a practice not only attended with very
great inconvenience, and no inconsiderable
danger, but even unnecessary. The
tendency, therefore, which this mode
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>of introducing mercury into the system
has of exciting salivation, may be considered
as no small objection to its being
put in practice.</p>

<p class='c015'>But, while it cannot be denied, that
salivation is attended with many inconveniencies,
it must at the same time be allowed,
that the degree in which it takes
place, is, in general, proportioned to the
quantity of active mercury which enters
the system. And it occurs chiefly in
those cases where the medicine is not
so acrid as to find an outlet by some other
excretory. When, therefore, the
disease has been of long standing, and
obstinately rooted in the system, altho’
salivation may not be necessary for a cure,
yet it will be the unavoidable consequence
of the employment of that quantity
of mercury which is requisite in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>system for overcoming the disease. This
mode of employing mercury, then, is not
in every case to be rejected from the tendency
which it has to excite salivation.</p>

<p class='c015'>But, it may further be objected to
this mode of employing mercury, that
the quantity of active mercury, which
in this way is introduced into the system,
cannot be easily ascertained. And
that, even before any obvious effect is
produced, a much greater quantity may
be thrown in, than is really necessary for
a cure, from which troublesome consequences
will afterwards ensue. These
indeed are facts which cannot be denied;
and it must even farther be allowed, that
all the good effects in the cure of <i>lues venerea</i>,
which can be obtained from this
method of introducing mercury into
the system, may be had from the internal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>use of other preparations equally
mild, and from which the patient is not
exposed to the same inconveniences.</p>

<p class='c015'>From these circumstances, it may be
concluded, that the introduction of mercury
into the system in the way of unction,
is neither proper in slight cases, nor
in the greatest number of obstinate ones.
There are, however, constitutions in
which mercury, in any form, is very apt
to produce an immediate and violent action
upon the alimentary canal. Sometimes
it excites vomiting, but more frequently
it induces looseness. In such
constitutions, these effects do indeed often
follow, even when the mercury is introduced
by the absorbents on the skin. But
they are more certainly the consequence
of the immediate application of mercury
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>to the alimentary canal itself. Besides
this, when these effects happen
from the immediate application of mercury
to the alimentary canal, the introduction
of the medicine into the
system, is often in a great measure,
if not entirely, frustrated. And farther,
the effects of mercury on the alimentary
canal not only less certainly
follows, from its introduction by the surface,
than from immediate application,
but may likewise be more easily obviated.
In such circumstances, therefore,
a cure of venereal complaints may, with
greater certainty and ease, be affected,
from the introduction of mercury by the
surface in the form of unction than from
any other mode of using it.</p>

<p class='c015'>Perhaps the most common form of
exhibiting mercury in this place, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>a view of entering the system, is that of
the mercurial pills. These, when properly
prepared, seem, in most cases, to
be justly entitled to the preference, which
is here so frequently given them. The
mercury, in this preparation, is rendered
active by the same means, and is in the
same state as in the preceeding one. Its
operation likewise in this form is very analogous
to what it is in the one formerly
mentioned. It is here equally
apt to salivate as in the form of unction.
But the salivation induced by the mercurial
pills very rarely arises to so high a
degree, at least so suddenly, as from unction.
The quantity of mercury introduced
into the system in this form, admits
of being more certainly ascertained
than by unction. The principal ambiguity
which takes place with regard to
the pills, arises from the difference of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>care with which they are prepared, and
the degree of solubility in the stomach
which those substances possess with which
the mercury is combined.</p>

<p class='c015'>The mercurial pills affect the guts less
than many other preparations of this metal.
This indeed might be inferred from
considering that the mercury is here in
a very mild state.</p>

<p class='c015'>From the use of mercurial pills,
mercury may be introduced into the system
in very considerable quantities. But,
as in this form it is not readily discharged
by the different emunctories, it is apt
to be accumulated in a greater quantity
than is requisite for slight cases. In these,
therefore, the pills are not so advisable as
some other preparations. But, where
the alimentary canal can bear mercury
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>with ease, the mercurial pills are perhaps
preferable to any other form, for those
obstinate cases where it is requisite, that
a considerable quantity of the medicine
in an active state should be introduced
into the system. And they are particularly
proper in those cases which are only to
be overcome by a gradual and long continued
use of mercury.</p>

<p class='c015'>To the forms of exhibiting mercury
which have already been mentioned, those
lately introduced by Mr Plenck of Vienna
may properly be subjoined. Of the
various preparations which he has proposed,
what he seems chiefly to have used
himself, and what has been principally
employed here, is his simple mercurial
solution. What is to be said, then,
concerning his preparations, as they are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>all very similar in their nature, may be
confined to this form.</p>

<p class='c015'>This gummous solution is, in the table
of mercurials, reduced to the same general
head with the two preparations last
treated of; the mercury in this case likewise
being rendered active by division
from triture. Although the use of this preparation
is but a late proposal, yet, since
its introduction, it has been a good deal
employed, and the facts which may be
had with regard to it cannot be alledged
to be few. That general observations,
however, may, with justice, be made,
numerous facts are requisite; and perhaps
what can as yet be had on this subject
are still an insufficient foundation for
any certain conclusions.</p>

<p class='c015'>It may, however, with regard to this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>medicine, be confidently asserted, that
the opinions upon which its superior efficacy
is founded are without foundation.
It is a mistake to suppose, that any
peculiar affinity, or specific elective attraction,
takes place betwixt mercury
and vegetable mucilage. And mercury
with gum, as well as in other forms, if,
from triture, it be rendered sufficiently
active, and if it be introduced into the system
in sufficient quantity, will also excite
salivation. This preparation, then,
is still to be considered as, in a great measure,
on the same footing with the two
others already mentioned.</p>

<p class='c015'>But, united with vegetable mucilage,
mercury seems to act less upon
the intestines than the mercurial pill.
This is probably to be referred to the
viscidity of the substance with which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>mercury is here combined. Vegetable
gum possesses a remarkable power of
sheathing and defending those parts to
which it is applied against acrimony of any
kind.</p>

<p class='c015'>This preparation, taken in what would
seem an equal proportion with the mercurial
pill, shows a less powerful action
on the system, both in its effects on the
excretions, and in its influence on the
morbid symptoms. This diminution
of action may perhaps, in some degree,
be accounted for from the mercury being
less readily absorbed into the system,
after entering the alimentary canal, in
consequence of the viscidity of the gum
with which it is united. But as vegetable
mucilage, when taken by itself, is
observed to diminish the action of mercury,
in whatever way it be introduced into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>the system, this effect must be principally
accounted for from some other cause.
Probably it depends upon the influence of
the mucilage, after having entered the
system, in defending the excretories against
the violence of the stimulus from
the mercury.</p>

<p class='c015'>This form may, upon the whole, be
esteemed, although not a powerful, yet,
in many cases, an useful preparation.
It is chiefly preferable to other mercurials
in those recent cases of <i>lues venerea</i>
where a weak preparation will answer
the purpose; and where, at the same
time, it seems most adviseable that the
mercury should be slowly introduced into
the system.</p>

<p class='c015'>The three preparations of mercury
which have already been treated of, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>compared with many others, may be esteemed
mild. There are a different set,
which, in opposition to these, may be
termed <i>acrid</i>. Of the acrid preparations,
not a few have likewise been used in the
cure of <i>lues venerea</i>, and for this purpose
introduced into the system in different
forms. To treat of all of these would
not only be deviating from our first intended
plan, but would lead to many
unnecessary repetitions, and needless inquiries,
with regard to medicines which
are now by no means in common use.
Calomel and corrosive sublimate may be
esteemed the two extremes of the acrid
preparations; the first being the mildest,
the last the most stimulant, which is, in
the present practice, ever used internally.
These two are, at the same time, the acrid
preparations which are perhaps
most frequently employed in the cure of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span><i>lues venerea</i>. To treat of these therefore
will be sufficient.</p>

<p class='c015'>Calomel, it has been observed, may
be considered as the mildest of the saline
preparations of mercury. In this preparation,
the basis of which is the corrosive
sublimate, the mercury is reduced
to the form of a saline compound, by
means of the muriatic acid. But it is
afterwards rendered less acrid, from the
addition of fresh mercury in repeated
sublimations. It has by many been esteemed
the most useful of the mercurial
preparations, not less for other purposes
for which mercury may be employed
than for the cure of the venereal
disease. The good effects which may
be obtained from its use in this complaint
are confirmed by undoubted experience.
And, when it is introduced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>into the system, there can be no question
with regard to its efficacy in destroying
the venereal virus.</p>

<p class='c015'>Calomel acts as a more general stimulant
in the system than the milder
preparations of mercury. And it discharges
itself by the different excretories,
when present in the mass of circulating
fluids, in no very considerable
quantity. Hence, it can be less accumulated
in the system than the other
preparations formerly mentioned. To
this circumstance it is probably owing,
that it less frequently excites salivation
than these do. If, indeed, it be given in
large doses frequently repeated, and
does not at the same time affect the intestinal
canal, it will excite salivation.
From this, it may be concluded, that
then the active mercury is present in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>system in a very considerable quantity.
But, when in this way, even such an accumulation
can be obtained, it is to be
considered only as on the same footing
with the milder mercurial preparations,
in those constitutions which are readily
salivated. Here, therefore, as in habits
naturally disposed to salivation, the presence
of any quantity of mercury in the
system will be very transient, and a salivation
occurring will often frustrate the
cure to be expected from it.</p>

<p class='c015'>Calomel, from its general stimulant
power, may readily be supposed to affect
the intestines more considerably than the
milder mercurial preparations; and, in
fact, it is found, that, in many cases, it
much more readily excites looseness than
they do. From this circumstance, it can
be less easily introduced into the system,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>especially if the alimentary canal possess
uncommon irritability.</p>

<p class='c015'>If these assertions with regard to this
mercurial preparation be well founded,
it will be easy to determine in what cases
calomel is preferable to other mercurials,
and in what it is to be considered as less
proper. It cannot be considered as well
adapted for those inveterate and obstinate
cases in which a long and gradual
use of mercury is requisite, and to
overcome which it is necessary that a
considerable quantity of mercury should
be accumulated in the circulating system.
On the other hand, if the intestines are
not very irritable, it will be particularly
serviceable, in many recent cases, in
which a speedy action of mercury is adviseable;
and, in those where the venereal
virus has not yet made its way into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>the circulating system, but is detained in
the lymphatic, or in the mucous glands.
From its sudden evacuant power, it may
likewise be of great service where mercurials
in the venereal disease are intended
to be conjoined with an antiphlogistic
course, or to make a part of it.</p>

<p class='c015'>What has been said of calomel may
be considered as sufficient, with regard
to the milder part of the saline preparations.
It now only remains, then, that
some observations should be offered on
corrosive sublimate, which is the most
acrid of these that is usually employed
internally.</p>

<p class='c015'>Corrosive sublimate, it has already
been observed, is the basis of the preparation
last treated of. But, in this preparation,
the mercury, from the proportion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>of muriatic acid which is united
with it, is in a very acrid state. When
taken in substance, even in a very inconsiderable
quantity, it proves a virulent poison
to the human frame. To this circumstance
it was probably owing, that, for
a very long time, it was used only for
external purposes, and even then, from
its high stimulant power, not without
the greatest caution. But the many inconveniencies
attending salivation, which
was at the same time found to be by no
means absolutely necessary to a cure, induced
practitioners to make trial of preparations
less apt to have that effect, than
those which had formerly been used. As
every preparation of mercury, in proportion
to its acrimony, has a greater
tendency to act upon the surface, and
less to affect the salivary glands, it is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>surprising that corrosive sublimate should
at length have been proposed.</p>

<p class='c015'>The violence with which corrosive sublimate
acts, has always been a sufficient
reason to prevent its being thrown in, either
in large quantities, or in substance.
Of late years, however, a weak solution
in ardent spirits has been recommended
as an efficacious remedy, and often used
with success. But, as it has been found
that the mercury is apt to precipitate
from this menstruum, if the solution is
kept for any time, water has often been
substituted to the spirits. Water is
perhaps, in every case, even by itself, a
better menstruum than spirits; but, besides
this, it may be much improved,
from having its solvent power increased
by the addition of sal ammoniac. By
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>this means, the precipitation of the mercury
may be, in a great measure, if not
totally, prevented.</p>

<p class='c015'>Corrosive sublimate, when introduced
into the system, is, as well as calomel,
very universally stimulant. But its
chief tendency, unless prevented by some
accident, is to operate upon the surface.
For the most part, it powerfully excites
diaphoresis, and in this way is speedily
evacuated from the system. But, if there
is in the patient’s constitution a want of
disposition to diaphoresis, or if the discharge
by the surface is suddenly checked
by the application of cold, it frequently
acts upon the salivary glands, inducing
salivation.</p>

<p class='c015'>From the success with which the use
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>of corrosive sublimate has been attended,
it cannot be doubted that it is highly
active in destroying the venereal virus.
And, either from the circumstance of
its entering the system more readily, or
from its greater activity, it produces an
equal effect, in the cure of <i>lues venerea</i>,
to what arises from most other mercurials,
even when it is employed in a less
considerable quantity.</p>

<p class='c015'>This preparation, in proportion to its
superior acrimony, is more apt to affect
the bowels than any of the other mercurials
already treated of. This circumstance
is, in many cases, an unsurmountable
objection to its use. From its high
stimulant power, it can never be lodged
in the system in any considerable quantity.
Notwithstanding its activity, therefore,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>it is not well fitted to eradicate obstinate
complaints. From its influence
upon the alimentary canal, its use cannot
with safety be continued for any
considerable length of time. It is not,
therefore, well adapted for those cases
which require a long and gradual use of
mercury.</p>

<p class='c015'>As this is a form in which a quantity
of very active mercury may suddenly
be introduced into the body, it may be
supposed well adapted for producing
some alleviation in urgent symptoms.
From the tendency it has to act upon
the surface of the body, it may be presumed
to be a preparation of great utility
against cutaneous affections from a
venereal cause. If recourse is had to the
examination of facts, it will be found,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>that the conclusion, which would here
be drawn from reasoning, is confirmed
by experience; and that, in reality, the
solution of corrosive sublimate may be
employed with peculiar advantage in both
these cases.</p>

<p class='c015'>Thus much with regard to calomel
and corrosive sublimate. Many other
preparations, of an intermediate degree
of acrimony between these, such, for example,
as the <i>mercurius calcinatus</i>, are
likewise in common use. But the cases
to which we would be inclined to suppose
these best adapted, may easily be
learned from what has been said of the
two extremes.</p>

</div>
<p class='c028'><i>Of the Cautions to be observed in the
Employment of Mercury in <span class="blackletter">Lues
Venerea</span>.</i></p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_8 c027'><span class='sc'>Few</span> medicines, from which any considerable
advantages can be obtained
in the cure of diseases, are of such a nature
that they can, in every circumstance,
be exhibited without any inconveniency.
On the contrary, the greater activity any
medicine possesses, the more reason there
is to apprehend disagreeable accidents
from its being improperly used. When
active medicines, therefore, are employed,
it becomes, in every case, an object
of particular attention, while we endeavour
to obtain all the good effects which
may be derived from them, to avoid those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>bad consequences which they are most
apt to induce.</p>

<p class='c015'>These ends are to be obtained only
by careful attention to many circumstances.
Of the accidents most to be
guarded against, not a few are, in a great
measure, the natural consequence of the
medicine itself. Although, in some constitutions,
and with particular treatment,
they will arise more readily than in others;
yet they may happen in any
constitution, and with any treatment.
As occurring, therefore, most generally,
they deservedly claim to be first considered.</p>

<p class='c015'>It has already been observed, that every
medicine, in proportion to its activity,
is more apt to be followed by consequences
not always to be wished for. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>may therefore be laid down as a general
rule, that active medicines should be employed
only in cases where they are absolutely
requisite. If this rule is proper
with regard to any medicine, it must be
so of mercury.</p>

<p class='c015'>It is however but too true, that mercury
is frequently employed in cases where
its use might readily be dispensed with.
And this holds not more of its employment
in other diseases, than in some venereal
complaints. When, indeed, the
venereal virus has actually entered the
system, perhaps a cure, by means of
mercury, is in every case at least to be attempted.
And a cure without it, by any
medicine at present in use, is seldom,
if ever, to be depended on. But, where
the matter occasioning the affection is
still in a state of topical application only,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>as happens in the case of gonorrhoea,
the introduction of mercury into the system
is totally unnecessary. And a cure
may be effected by other means, not only
with greater safety and ease, but likewise
with more expedition.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mercury, in an active state, when introduced
into the system, has, in every
case, more or less a tendency to affect the
intestines. This action, while it seldom
co-operates with its other effects in curing
the disease, frequently produces the most
mischievous consequences in the constitution.
When it occurs, therefore, it
is but natural to think of checking it.
This may often be successfully done, by
the employment of means fitted to promote
a determination to the surface.
Where this method fails, it may frequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>be obviated, by giving opium
at the same time with the mercurial.</p>

<p class='c015'>Another consequence which often
arises from active mercury, when
introduced into the system in any considerable
quantity, is its exciting salivation.
This discharge is attended with
numberless inconveniencies, and it is at
the same time no farther necessary to a
cure, than as it is a proof of the quantity
of active mercury which is in the
system. But, where mercury in the
greatest quantity is requisite to a cure,
to keep the patient upon the verge of
a salivation is all that is necessary. Salivation,
then, on its first appearance, is
always to be restrained. For this purpose,
it is necessary, that the use of the
medicine should for a little be intermitted.
Where that is insufficient, determination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>to the surface, by means of
diluent diaphoretics, has a tendency to
restrain this discharge as well as the former,
and may often, for this purpose,
be used with advantage. But, in general,
salivation will be most successfully
checked, by increasing the determination
to the intestines by means of cooling
purgatives.</p>

<p class='c015'>As well as other discharges, that by
sweat may likewise, from the use of mercurials,
take place in a degree not to be
wished for. Although this discharge is
attended with much less inconvenience
than either of the two already mentioned,
yet it may often be proper to restrain
it. This may be done by keeping the
patient more thinly clothed, and in a
cooler temperature than before, and by
a cautious exposure to open air.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>The accidents already enumerated
are the most common ones which can
be considered as depending on the nature
of the medicine itself. But, besides
these, a variety of others, although less
frequently occurring, might likewise be
referred to this source. Independent of
that affection of the gums and mouth,
which, for the most part, is the forerunner
of salivation, it sometimes happens, even
where no particular exposure to cold can
be blamed as a cause, that the whole
head is remarkably swelled. Where
this takes place, it is in general the consequence
of throwing in the mercury
too suddenly, and may best be avoided
by a more sparing and gradual use
of the medicine.</p>

<p class='c015'>From continuing the use of mercury
for a considerable time, in some cases,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>febrile complaints will arise. These, if
they admit of a cure, while the use of
the mercury is continued, will most readily
be overcome by the means commonly
employed for the relief of hectic fever.
But it seldom happens, that these
symptoms can be removed without omitting
the use of the mercury. In such
cases, therefore, even although from the
remaining appearance of a venereal taint,
the farther continuance of mercury
would seem adviseable, yet, when these
febrile symptoms supervene, it is for the
most part necessary, to trust the cure to
other means.</p>

<p class='c015'>The action of every medicine, and
consequently the circumstances claiming
attention in its employment, are considerably
varied by peculiarities in the habit
in which it is given. What, in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>respect, therefore, is chiefly to be attended
to in the use of mercury, falls next to
be considered.</p>

<p class='c015'>Although it has been observed, that
the accidents already mentioned may
happen in any habit; yet it is certain,
that in some particular habits, they will
much more readily take place than in
others. Where constitutions, therefore,
naturally exposed to these accidents do
occur, it is necessary, that the means to
be employed for preventing the inconveniencies
which would arise from
thence, should be had recourse to, more
early than in patients of a different constitution.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mercury, when introduced into the
system, has always a tendency to produce
evacuation.  At particular periods of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>life, evacuation is less easily born than
at others. Hence, the long continued
use of this medicine, or its employment in
a considerable quantity, are always particularly
to be avoided with people much
advanced in life, or with infants.</p>

<p class='c015'>During infancy, mercury may likewise
produce inconvenience, from its stimulant
power. On this account, the
more acrid preparations are, during
that period of life, to be avoided. If,
however, their use should be esteemed
necessary, they are to be employed only
in small doses.</p>

<p class='c015'>Stimulants are not more dangerous
in irritable habits than they are in
plethoric ones; or in those in whom the
force of the circulating fluids is very
great. On this account, with patients in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>the vigour of life, evacuation is often requisite
previous to the use of mercury.</p>

<p class='c015'>These observations suggested by the
age of patients using mercury, would
naturally lead to the consideration of
such as result from sex. From the laws
of the male system, few, if any directions
which will not fall under other
heads, are peculiar to men; but, in the
female œconomy, there are many circumstances
which require particular notice.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mercury promotes menstruation,
and is apt to produce it in an excessive
degree. On this account, it is always
proper to intermit its use for some time
previous to the flow of the menses, and
during the continuance of this discharge.
From the influence it has upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>this evacuation, its use to any considerable
degree during the term of pregnancy,
is totally inadmissible. When
mercury is used during nursing, it has
such an effect upon the milk, that a child
suckled by a woman who takes it, may
by that means be cured of the venereal
disease.</p>

<p class='c015'>In different diseases, where the child is
healthful, the influence of mercury on the
milk would be an objection to its use, during
nursing, for any particular complaints
of the woman. But, where a nurse labours
under the venereal disease, since
in this situation she can never be
supposed to suckle a child not likewise
infected, as the remedy is equally necessary
for both, there is no reason for delaying
to attempt a cure during that period.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>The different temperaments of patients,
as far as they are marked by obvious
signs, and have been distinguished
by medical writers, afford little ground
for particular observations with regard
to the use of mercury. What has been
said with regard to the prime of life,
holds more especially with those of a sanguine
habit; and the observation made
concerning old age, in some degree, applies
to the melancholic. But, with all
temperaments, mercurials may in general
be used without any peculiar preparation;
and, during their use in such
cases, no particular cautions are necessary
which will not be suggested by other
circumstances.</p>

<p class='c015'>But, although it is necessary to say little
with regard to temperaments obviously
distinguishable; yet it is well known,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>that very great varieties in the operation
of mercury arise from peculiarities in
constitution. And this happens where
there are no particular marks indicating
such a singularity. Some constitutions
are affected by mercury with very great
ease, whether as acting on the alimentary
canal, or as entering the system,
and exerting its effects there. In cases,
therefore, where the constitution of the
patient is not previously known, some
degree of preference is, on this account,
due to the mildest forms. And, in those
cases for which the more acrid ones seem
best fitted, it is necessary to begin with
the employment of small doses; and, if
the action of these shall be found to be
too violent, to have recourse to the different
means of taking off sensibility.
The most immediate, and perhaps the
most effectual, means of removing or diminishing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>sensibility, is by the use of opium.
But the same end may, in many
cases, be obtained with equal ease,
and less hazard, from the use of emollient
and mild diluents; such as decoctions
and emulsions, abounding with vegetable
mucilage.</p>

<p class='c015'>While some constitutions are easily
affected by mercury, others, on the contrary,
are acted upon with difficulty only.
With these last, after the use of even
a very considerable quantity of mercury,
little, or perhaps no obvious action
on the system can be observed. This is
to be ascribed to one of two causes; either
it arises from the mercury’s never
having entered the system; or from its
being accumulated there without proving
a stimulus to any secretion. In the latter
of these cases, all the effects wanted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>from the use of mercury may be obtained
with greater ease than in any other.</p>

<p class='c015'>The only thing, then, which is necessary
in such cases is to proceed with caution,
and not to throw into the system an unnecessary
quantity of mercury, by which the
patient may be exposed to those inconveniencies
which, in a greater or less
degree, accompany every increased excretion.</p>

<p class='c015'>But it is not always an easy matter to
distinguish betwixt this and the case first
mentioned, in which it was alledged,
that the want of obvious action arose
from the mercury’s not having entered
the system. When this happens, a gradual
and slow procedure would not only
be losing time to the patient, but allowing
the disease to gain ground. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>only certain mark for distinguishing betwixt
these two cases, is the change produced
in the morbid symptoms. In the
one, the disease remains either unaltered
or increased; in the other, all the symptoms
are manifestly changed for the
better.</p>

<p class='c015'>If, from this test, it appear, that the
want of obvious action after the use of
mercury proceeds from its not having entered
the system, a very different treatment
is necessary from what was proposed
in the former case. Here it is requisite,
without loss of time, to have recourse
either to a different preparation
of mercury from what was formerly used,
or to a different method of introducing
the medicine.</p>

<p class='c015'>The circumstances already mentioned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>as claiming attention, regard peculiarities
of constitution where no other disease
except <i>lues venerea</i> can properly be
said to exist. But it often happens, that
the venereal disease exists in patients who
are, at the same time, affected with other
complaints. This affords a very
extensive field for particulars to be attended
to in the employment of mercury.
To treat of the variety of diseases which
may, in any degree, be affected by it,
would be an almost endless task. In
some, the mercury will be of service, as
tending to a cure; many others, on the
contrary, are by its use rendered evidently
worse. Its influence in aggravating
complaints has been said to hold, among
a variety of other diseases, in cases
of epilepsy, gout, and rheumatism. But
on this subject attention is chiefly requisite
to scurvy and hæmoptoe.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>In scurvy, mercury very generally occasions
a quicker progress of all the complaints.
Hence, when, in such circumstances,
it easily can be avoided, it is a
medicine never to be employed. Cases,
however, will occur, in which, although
scurvy actually does exist, the use of mercury
will be adviseable. In such cases,
if the mercury is used slowly and cautiously,
a cure of the venereal symptoms
may be obtained, without rendering the
scorbutic complaints much worse; but,
if the mercury be suddenly thrown in,
disagreeable symptoms will often arise.
Of these, the principal are fœtid gangrenous
ulcers, affecting the inside of the
cheeks, the tongue, the palate, or the
gums. It may farther be observed, that,
although these are in general the consequences
of the imprudent use of mercury;
yet they will sometimes arise where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>it has been used even with the greatest
caution. When they do happen, let
their cause be what it will, there is, in
every case, so much danger as to make
it necessary to discontinue the use of mercury.
Recourse is then first to be had
to the employment of such means as are
best calculated for the removal of scurvy.
If this can once be effected, the
removal of the venereal complaints may
be attempted, either by the employment
of other means of cure, or even by resuming
the use of mercury.</p>

<p class='c015'>Another complaint, which may be
complicated with the venereal disease,
and during the existence of which particular
caution is necessary in the use of
mercury, is hæmoptoe. That habit of
body which particularly disposes to hæmoptoe
is well known, and, even where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>the disease has never existed, can be detected
by obvious marks. Many patients,
after having been once attacked
with hæmoptoe, are seemingly cured,
and have every appearance of being restored
to perfect health. Both these situations
may be considered as, in a great
measure, the same: In either, hæmoptoe
will be induced from very trifling
causes. Among others, the use of mercury
has frequently been observed to
have this effect. In all such cases, then,
it is necessary that mercury should be used
in small doses, and introduced slowly
into the system.</p>

<p class='c015'>Notwithstanding every precaution,
it sometimes will happen, that hæmoptoe
will arise from the use of mercury.
When this is the case, it is necessary
not only to abstain from the use
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>of the medicine, but to have recourse
to those means which are found to be
most effectual in the cure of so dangerous
a symptom. For this purpose, bleeding,
refrigerants, and astringents, must
be employed, as the circumstances of the
patient direct. While the hæmoptoe
continues, the use of mercury is not to
be attempted. And although, by these
means, it should happen to be removed,
this medicine, unless in cases
where the venereal symptoms are very
urgent, is not to be ventured upon for
some time, even in the most gentle forms.</p>

<p class='c015'>We have now pointed out the principal
circumstances claiming attention in the
employment of mercurials, which depend
either on the nature of the medicine itself,
or on the condition of the patient
in whom it is employed. It now only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>remains, then, to offer some observations
with regard to the necessary regimen.
What is to be said on this subject will
respect either diet, temperature, or exercise;
each of which may be considered
in order.</p>

<p class='c015'>It has been alledged, that mercury operates
in the cure of <i>lues venerea</i> by
acting as an antidote to the virus which
produces the disease. If this is the case,
it is difficult to see how any particular
diet can have the least tendency to promote
its operation. In adapting the
diet to the medicine, then, the principal
thing to be attended to, in this case, is,
to order such a one as will most readily
counteract those accidents which the medicine
is apt to induce. The accidents chiefly
to be guarded against, from the use
of mercury, are those arising from its stimulant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>power. In diet, therefore, it is in
the first place requisite, that every thing
stimulant should be avoided. And then,
if it can be done, such substances are to
be employed as, when taken into the system,
have a tendency to counteract a stimulus.</p>

<p class='c015'>From these general principles, it is easy
to see what diet is in this case to be recommended.
The use of butcher-meat,
and indeed of animal food in general,
of wine, and of spirits of all kinds, are,
from their stimulant quality, if not to be
totally forbid, at least to be used sparingly.
Food of every kind much salted,
or highly seasoned, is to be discharged.
And all such substances as would
act upon the mercury, while yet in the
stomach, are particularly to be avoided.
The diet should be of the mildest and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>blandest nature, consisting chiefly of farinaceous,
and mucilaginous vegetables,
and of milk. The drink should be such
as will quench thirst and dilute, if at the
same time the patient will take what will
act likewise as a demulcent, it is often
preferable to such fluids as will answer
only the two first intentions. For these
purposes, water with toast, milk and water,
barley-water, mucilaginous emulsions,
or the like, may be employed with
advantage.</p>

<p class='c015'>The diet here pointed out as most
suited to the nature of the medicine,
is likewise best adapted to that of
the complaint. As the venereal disease
depends upon the introduction of a peculiar
virulent matter into the system, it
will scarce be imagined, that any species
of diet can have great influence in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>the cure. But, when it is considered,
that the manner in which this matter acts,
is, in the first instance, by exciting inflammation,
it may readily be conceived,
that, from a particular diet, its action
may be rendered less violent than it
would be otherwise. As, for this purpose,
the antiphlogistic regimen is unquestionably
the most proper, it is only
necessary to add to what has already
been observed, that the diet above recommended
should be used sparingly.</p>

<p class='c015'>It has very universally been esteemed
necessary, that those who use mercury
should be kept in a warm temperature.
And it is an undoubted fact, that no medicine
renders the body more susceptible
of injury from cold than mercury.
In consequence of a sudden exposure to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>cold during the use of this medicine, the
most fatal accidents have been observed
to arise. He therefore who has taken
mercury cannot be too cautious in
guarding against this extreme.</p>

<p class='c015'>But, to avoid the inconvenience
which may be produced by cold, there is
no necessity for running into the opposite
extreme. Confinement to a very
warm chamber, and the use of a number
of flannels, produce a temperature
which, although not so dangerous as cold,
is equally improper. The cure of <i>lues
venerea</i>, if not frustrated by the discharges
thus promoted, is often retarded,
and less easily obtained than it
would otherwise be. After a patient has
for some time been kept warm, a sudden
exposure to cold is hurtful, because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>the parts are unable to bear the stimulus
which it occasions. The same effect does
not follow upon a change from a cold to
a hot temperature, not only because this
is seldom so sudden, but because it likewise
promotes many different evacuations.</p>

<p class='c015'>There appears then an evident cause
why the one extreme is more dangerous
than the other. But the inconvenience
from either is a sufficient objection to it.
What is required of temperature during
the use of mercury, is, that it be such as
to support a proper balance betwixt the
different excretions. To obtain this, a
temperature inclining to neither extreme
is in general the most proper. When,
however, there appears in the constitution
a peculiar disposition to the augmentation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>of any excretion, the temperature
in which the patient is kept should
incline to the extreme least apt to encourage
it.</p>

<p class='c015'>From what has been said of temperature,
it will appear, that it is not necessary
in every case, and at every season of
the year, that those who take mercury
should be confined to a chamber. But,
when the circumstances are such as to
admit of a patient’s going abroad, all
violent exercise is to be avoided. From
violent exercise, the patient is liable to
the same inconveniencies as from a hot
temperature, and frequently to all the
dangers resulting from a sudden exposure
to cold. Of exercise, as of temperature,
it may be observed, that it should
be so regulated, as to support a proper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>balance among the different excretions.
For this purpose, when the patient is abroad,
moderate exercise is in general
requisite. For the same reason also,
even when the patient is confined to his
chamber, such moderate exercise as can
there be obtained, is for the most part

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg&#8482; works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
